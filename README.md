# mega-pi

calculate a 'large' pi number using java to examine the frequency of each single digit (is Pi normal?)

it is a sampleproject to show young students how interisting math can be
we want to examine what Pi is and how it can be calculated, starting by measuring the circumference and the diameter

I was inspired by this article:http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/mathematik-ist-die-kreiszahl-pi-normal-a-895876.html(this is a test project to understand and learn more about git)

next steps are:
implementing multithreading to speedup the calculating process cause it's using only one core at this time
create a graphical frontend
